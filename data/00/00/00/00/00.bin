  |   Eternum Ex is a retro platform video game with the look and feel of   |
  |   the '80s arcade cabinet games.                                        |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Sir Arthur has gotten old... too old. He has lost everything he had   |
  |   and loved, and with nothing more to lose he leaves for Samarnath,     |
  |   an evil subterranean kingdom (which no knight has ever returned       |
  |   alive) in search of treasures, adventures and the most important:     |
  |   five magical orbs that together provide: the Eternal youth.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Thanks to its progressive difficulty curve, and with a path divided   |
  |   into "worlds" of 5 levels each one, Eternum Ex is challenging,        |
  |   addictive and an ode to the nostalgia of the golden age of arcade     |
  |   games.                                                                |

  |   Easy to play, hard to master.                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   With a very simple core gameplay mechanics, an increasing             |
  |   difficulty, an exciting and addictive gameplay, and with a very       |
  |   precise control, Eternum Ex is perfect for retro hardcore gamers      |
  |   but also for those who want to start in retro games, and even for     |
  |   those who want to show children how games were when game industry     |
